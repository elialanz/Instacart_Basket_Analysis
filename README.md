## Instacart Basket Analysis Project

The Instacart Basket Analysis project involved analyzing an open-source grocery dataset to uncover customer purchasing patterns, spending trends, and regional behaviors that could inform marketing and sales strategies. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn), I extracted insights from over 30 million grocery orders and created visual summaries to identify customer segments, product preferences, and optimal timing for promotional activities.

### Instacart Data Analysis & Insights

In this project, I worked with Instacart’s historical transaction data to analyze how different customer groups shop, how frequently they return, and which departments contribute most to overall sales. The findings were summarized into a management-ready report highlighting key opportunities to improve customer retention and targeted marketing.

The project began with data cleaning and consistency checks, where I identified and addressed missing values, duplicates, and non-uniform entries across multiple datasets (orders, products, order_products_prior, and customers). I then created derived variables such as loyalty status, price range, spending level, and customer profiles to enable deeper segmentation and behavioral analysis.

**Next, I performed data aggregations and groupby operations to answer core business questions, such as:**
- Which departments receive the highest number of product orders?
- How does customer spending vary across different regions?
- Which customer profiles show the highest purchasing frequency and order value?

After completing the Python analysis, I compiled the results into a clear, Excel-based presentation featuring charts, crosstabs, and heatmaps. This deliverable summarized patterns in loyalty distribution, regional purchasing behavior, and high-performing product categories such as Produce, Dairy & Eggs, and Beverages.

To ensure transparency and reproducibility, I also exported the final cleaned dataset and included all variable derivations and documentation within the Excel report. Finally, I organized a complete Jupyter workflow for technical colleagues, detailing each step of the data wrangling, merging, and analysis process.

### This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Clean, merge, and structure multi-source datasets efficiently in Python.
- Derive analytical variables and create behavioral customer segments.
- Translate data into meaningful visual insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Communicate findings clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.
- Document analytical workflows and outputs with professional clarity.
